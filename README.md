A simple android app for tracking claims while travelling 

USAGE
MainMenu - 
  The user should create a claim through the Change or Add new Claim menu
  from here the use should see a list of currently available claims and will 
  load the claim on clicking it. 
  on a long click the user should be able to edit the claim
  
  Once the user has made and selected a claim the user can go back to the main menu
  from here the user can add a new expense item by pressing the Add a new item button
  this will open up a form where the user is able to input the status of the expense, 
  the category, any instances of multiple types of currency, a brief description, and 
  a date range. When finished press done and if adding the new item was successful the
  user will recieve a confirm message. 
  
  Once the user has added some expense items the user may then view or edit them in the
  view or edit and claim button. From here the user will see a list of all his expense items
  and is able to edit them by pressing any item. If the user long presses and item it will be 
  deleted
  WARNING : NO PROMPT FOR DELETION
  The user is able to email expense items individually or email the entire claim





side note(personal thoughts): Had gotten quite confused with the difference between a claim and expense didn't notice I have                               the incorrect structure until I had gone to do the video (oops)
